Testing Learndo
================

Learndo is an assignment portal for teachers and students.

In order to test the login process, we need to set up the Selenium WebDriver::

	>>> from selenium import webdriver
	>>> browser = webdriver.Firefox()

First, the user will open the homepage::

	>>> browser.get('http://localhost:5000')

Make sure the homepage template was rendered::

	>>> browser.title
	u'Learndo'

Let's try logging in as a teacher::
	>>> username = browser.find_element_by_name('username')
	>>> password = browser.find_element_by_name('password')
	>>> btn = browser.find_element_by_id("login-button")
	>>> username.send_keys("teachertest")
	>>> password.send_keys("test")
	>>> btn.click()

The navbar is different for students and teachers. There should be 5 icons in the navbar of the teacher's view::
	>>> result = browser.find_elements_by_css_selector("ul.nav.navbar-nav li")
	>>> len(result)
	5

If you visit the homepage once you're logged in, you should be redirected to the assignments list::
	>>> browser.get('http://localhost:5000')
	>>> browser.current_url
	u'http://localhost:5000/teacher/0/assignments'

A teacher can create and edit assignments, assign them to classes, view assignments with a list of each student's progress status, create student accounts, create classes, add students to classes, delete classes, as well as viewing and editing student profiles. But teachers cannot access a student's or another teacher's assignment list::
	>>> browser.get('http://localhost:5000/student/3/assignments')
	>>> result = browser.find_element_by_id("flash")
	>>> result.text == "You do not have access to that page."
	True

If we log out and log in again as a student, the navbar in the student view should have only 3 icons.
	>>> browser.get('http://localhost:5000/logout')
	>>> username = browser.find_element_by_name('username')
	>>> password = browser.find_element_by_name('password')
	>>> btn = browser.find_element_by_id("login-button")
	>>> username.send_keys("studenttest")
	>>> password.send_keys("test")
	>>> btn.click()
	>>> result = browser.find_elements_by_css_selector("ul.nav.navbar-nav li")
	>>> len(result)
	3

Students can view a list of their assignments and the details of an assignment, check or uncheck an assignment completed, and make changes to their profile. But students cannot access pages from a teacher's view or that of any other user::
	>>> browser.get('http://localhost:5000/teacher/0/assignments')
	>>> result = browser.find_element_by_id("flash")
	>>> result.text == "You do not have access to that page."
	True

These tests highlight the design of the apps login system and the different permissions and views for student and teacher accounts. 

Close browser window::
	browser.quit()
